			<h1> Adam Claussen - About Me </h1>
			<p class="first-cl">My name is Adam Claussen, and I am currently a 20 year old student at the University of Toledo. Presently, 
			I am working on getting my Bachelors of Information Technology from UT, and I hope to go into the IT job force once I get my 
			degree. I have worked with a multitude of programming languages, including C#, C++, Java, HTML, and some other, less well-known
			languages, although I am not heavily proficient with any of them. I am also familiar with computers and computer hardware, though
			it's hard to keep up with such a fast-changing field.</p>
			<p class="second-cl">In my off time, I am an avid gamer and spend much of my time playing a myriad of games. I enjoy games ranging
			from Role-Playing Games to Real-Time Strategy to First-Person Shooters, and all things in-between. Just a few honourable mentions 
			include: </p>
			<ul class="game-mentions">
				<li>- DOTA 2 -</li>
				<li>- Warcraft 3 -</li>
				<li>- Skyrim -</li>
				<li>- Crusader Kings II -</li>
				<li>- Dragon Age: Inquisition -</li>
			</ul>
